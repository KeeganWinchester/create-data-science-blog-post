## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using a Superbowl Ad Dataset from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: What are some of the most commonly used words in slogans?

Question 2: How many words does a typical slogan have?

Question 3: What's the secret behind the popular slogans?

Question 4: Are certain slogans specific to a certain industry? 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@keegancwinchester/what-makes-up-a-slogan-c0adb093e221).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data.
